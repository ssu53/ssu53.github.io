Hello!
======

I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University, rotating with [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/) and [Carlos Guestrin](https://guestrin.su.domains/). I am broadly interested in machine learning. I am supported by the Stanford School of Engineering Fellowship and the Stanford EDGE Fellowship.

I received an MPhil in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, where I worked on learning over graphs with [Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and [Petar Veličković](https://petar-v.com/). I was supported by the Open Philanthropy Scholarship. In previous lives, I was a trader at [D. E. Shaw & Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/) and a physics major at Princeton University, studying condensed matter theory.



Research
======


* **Explaining Hypergraph Neural Networks: From Local Explanations to Global Concepts**  
  Shiye Su, Iulia Duta, Lucie Charlotte Magister, Pietro Liò  
  We design an architecture-agnostic, post-hoc method to produce faithful and concise explanations for hypergraph neural networks.  
  [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07764)

* **Commute-Time-Optimised Graphs for GNNs**  
  Igor Sterner, Shiye Su, Petar Veličković  
  ICML 2024, GRaM workshop (PMLR)  
  We develop a graph rewiring procedure based on Cayley expanders, reducing oversquashing and incorporating user priors.  
  [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08762)

* **ALMANACS: A Simulatability Benchmark for Language Model Explainability**  
  Edmund Mills, Shiye Su, Stuart Russell, Scott Emmons  
  We introduce a simulatability benchmark for language model interpretability, comprising structured, idiosyncratic questions with test-time distributional shift.  
  [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12747)

* **Fitness Aware Human Motion Generation with Fine-Tuning**  
  Kiril Bikov, Shiye Su, Deepro Choudhury, Zhilin Guo, Weihao Xia, Mehmet Salih Çeliktenyıldız, Chenliang Zhou, Param Hanji, Cengiz Oztireli  
  NeurIPS 2025, FITML Workshop  
  We condition a human motion diffusion model on subject fitness, learning from a motion-capture dataset of graded Functional Movement Screen actions.  
  [[paper]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BTSnh5YdeI)

* **Chaos and Measurement-Induced Criticality on Stabiliser Circuits**  
  Shiye Su  
  My undergraduate thesis was advised by [Sarang Gopalakrishnan](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/sarang-gopalakrishnan) and [David Huse](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/david-huse). We studied the entanglement transition in a many-body system evolving under Clifford gates and projective measurements, as well as the spectral and thermalisation properties of Clifford gates.

Miscellaneous
======

I am from Australia :) 
In 2023, I walked for one month from the French Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela.
My first research project claims to find a heuristic for the Travelling Salesman Problem by tracking C. Elegans worms in chemotaxis.
